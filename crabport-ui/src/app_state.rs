//! Application-level shared state.
//!
//! All windows in the process share a single `AppState` via GPUI's global
//! mechanism (`cx.set_global` / `cx.global`). The main terminal window and
//! any auxiliary windows (Settings, About, ...) read/write through the same
//! `Store` handle so persistence stays consistent across windows.
//!
//! `Store` itself is `Send` but not `Sync` (rusqlite's `Connection` is not
//! `Sync`), so we wrap it in `parking_lot::Mutex`. The resulting
//! `Arc<Mutex<Store>>` is `Send + Sync` and can live in a GPUI `Global`.
